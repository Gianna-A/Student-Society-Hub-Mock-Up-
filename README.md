# Student-Society-Hub-Mock-Up-

This project is a mini mock-up of university society platform, designed to manage students, societies, and events. I developed this for a university coursework assignment; it focuses mainly on backend functionality With basic frontend development, while showcasing essential skills with database management and server side development. The application allows users to add, view, and edit information related to students and societies.
